City Traffic is a Crowed Source based project to better understand the traffic situations and the Road situation on Real time. This was a project made for an MBA subject and made Open Source. We welcome contributions from everyone. While contributing, please follow the project code of conduct, so that everyone can be included.

If you'd like to help make City Traffic better, here are some ways you can contribute:

    by reporting bugs you encounter

    by improving the Read Me which will act as the documentation
    by taking part in feature and issue discussions
    by adding a failing test for reproducible reported bugs
    by reviewing pull requests and suggesting improvements
    by writing code (no patch is too small! fix typos or bad whitespace)
