## Code of Conduct


A primary goal of this project is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse 
backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, 

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences
for unacceptable behavior. ***We do not tolerate any type of harassement by any member of community regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).:x:*** 

We preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive.
This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more 
likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by people answering 
will be more easily detected and corrected.

- Behave profesionaly 
- Be respectful to others.
- Be careful in the words that we choose.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

Members who will violate these rules, no matter how much they have contributed to the project,will be approached by a member 
of the leadership team. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with the leadership team member the contributer
will be asked to discontinue their participation in the development of the project.
 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a team member
immediately.
